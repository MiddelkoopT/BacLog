WARNING! This experimental research code is incomplete and interacts
with real hardware, and such, should only be used by experienced
professionals familiar with BACnet and HVAC systems in a controlled
setting. Always follow proper safety procedures.

Much of this code may be site/device specific and only implements a
portion of the BACnet protocol.  This system has collected over 2.5
billions samples from 20,000 points from a single building over a
period of two years. If you use the software please let the authors
know and contribute your work back.
